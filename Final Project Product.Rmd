This dataset deals with untidy, raw data for recording global plastic pollution. [https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/readme.md]

Here below, I used R to clean up the data and try to get it into working condition.

```{r}
plastics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv')
glimpse(plastics)
```




```{python}
### Python
print("Hello World")

```
