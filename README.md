# BSC4456C Final Project Submission

This project involves working with global plastic pollution data (tidytuesday), with the goal of seeing if there is any correlation among the data collected. The final product is labeled Final-Project-Product, both with .Rmd and .HTML. The project proposal is also present. This links to my other repository that showcases what I learned with python.
